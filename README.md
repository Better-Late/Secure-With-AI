## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- API keys for:
  - Google Gemini AI
  - VirusTotal (optional, for hash analysis)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Better-Late/Secure-With-AI.git
   cd Secure-With-AI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies with uv**

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_virustotal_api_key_here
   LOCAL=true (for local development)
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the web interface**
   
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage

### Single Product Analysis

1. Enter the **Company Name** (e.g., "Microsoft")
2. Enter the **Product Name** (e.g., "Visual Studio Code")
3. (Optional) Enter a **File Hash** for VirusTotal analysis
4. Click **Analyze** to generate the security report

### Batch Analysis

1. Prepare a CSV file with the following columns:
   ```
   company_name,product_name,hash
   Microsoft,Visual Studio Code,abc123...
   Mozilla,Firefox,def456...
   ```

2. Click **Upload CSV** in the sidebar
3. Click **Load CSV Data**
4. Click **Analyze All** to process all entries at once

### Understanding the Trust Score

The **Trust Score** (0-100) is calculated based on:

- **Popularity Score** (via Google Trends) - 66.7% weight in reputation
- **CVE Vulnerability Score** - 33.3% weight in reputation
  - Unsolved CVEs: ×1.5 penalty
  - Unknown status: ×1.2 penalty
  - Solved CVEs: ×1.0 (no penalty)
- **VirusTotal Score** (if hash provided) - 50% of final score when available
- **GDPR Penalty** - Up to 10 points deducted for enforcement actions
- **Data Breach Penalty** - Up to 10 points deducted for breach history

**Special Cases:**
- Malware-flagged software receives a fixed score of **10/100**
- Products with no information receive a score of **0/100**

Click the **Score Details** button in the UI for the full mathematical breakdown.
